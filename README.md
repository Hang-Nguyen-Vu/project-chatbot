# Project Chatbot  

A chatbot taking order for ice-creams.

## The problem

The project makes use of functions, DOM manipulation and event listeners in Javascript to create the flow of questions. I planned out the structure including the steps that should happen in each question and followed it. The CSS file is also updated to change the look of the chatbot. 
Potential improvements include:
- Fixing the delay between button click and print-out of user's choice on screen and chatbot's confirmation of the choice
- Adding prices to each item and calculate total price at the end before the user confirms the order
- Adding photos of the products
